# Swap My Cookies 

Install from here: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dffhipnliikkblkhpjapbecpmoilcama 

Swap My Cookies manages your cookies, letting you login on any website with several different accounts. You can finally login in gmail, yahoo, hotmail, and just any website you use, with all your accounts; if you want to use another account just swap profile!

You can keep in memory all your profiles, and switch among them as needed; if you share your pc just swap the profile and you are done, instead of logging out from every account and logging in again! if you have multiple mail accounts use one profile per mail!

Note: when the profile is changed, so are all the cookies stored by the browser. This means that if you have gmail and yahoo opened and you switch profile, the account changes in both pages, this is a limitation I had to impose, because of the many challenges I would have had to face and probably, at last, failure.

This extension is inspired by CookieSwap, which is a Firefox only add-on. The code, however, is entirely original and is released under GNU GPL license.

If you like "Swap my Cookies" you might also like "Edit this Cookie" These 2 extensions are integrated and work nicely together...it's Recommended to have both!
